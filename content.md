## Introduction

Hi, come to know `Great Knot` (Calidris tenuirostris)! It is a small wader, but also a great long-distance migratory shorebird of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. 

Here is a great knot~ Her tag may say "XNC", but she is Beak Beak to the reseacher. As a "research assistant" of Deakin University, Australia, Beak Beak will carry a small solar-satellite device throughout this summer. Let's see how is she doing.

## Starting

This is Beak Beak's home in Broome, Australia. A beautiful beach with lots of molluscs and insects.

It's getting colder here... Maybe it's time to start!!
