## Introduction

Hi, come to know `Great Knot` (Calidris tenuirostris)! It is a small wader, but also a great long-distance migratory shorebird of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. 

Here is a great knot~ Her tag may say "XNC", but she is Beak Beak to the reseacher. As a "research assistant" of Deakin University, Australia, Beak Beak will carry a small solar-satellite device throughout this summer. Let's see how is she doing.

## Starting

陪沙滩图，最好有鸟。

It's getting colder here... Maybe it's time to start!!


不知不觉已经到四月中旬了，是时候补充一些能量来继续前进了。这里是它能够在旅途中饱餐一顿的机会。成片的沙滩，滩涂以及沼泽，对于他来说，简直就是一个自助餐厅。 beach with lots of molluscs and insects. 

它用它充满感受器的喙，深入3-5cm的泥土之中，寻觅着它的午餐。在这一个月之中，他会不断往返于中国黄海这片海域，每天换不一样的餐厅。

值得注意的是，由于近些年来，沿海地图的过度发展，这样好的餐厅（湿地）已经变得越来越少。（可视化待补充）



Many sandpipers form monogamous pairs, so does Beak Beak. She meets her husband in northeast Siberia. They finds a tundra that is perfect for babies.

They exchange on the nest in the morning and in the evening so that their incubation rhythm follows a 24-hour day. Their children hatch after about three weeks of incubation and are able to walk and forage within a few hours of hatching. Beak Beak and her husband guide and brood their children together.
